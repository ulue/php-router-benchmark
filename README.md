# PHP Router Benchmark

The intent here is to benchmark different PHP routing solutions. This is a micro-optimization, done purely out of 
dumb curiosity.

- the test script is forked form https://github.com/tyler-sommer/php-router-benchmark
- test frmaework is: https://github.com/ulue/nice-bench. it is forked form `nice/bench`
- **Test time** 2017.12.03

## Installation

Clone the repo, run `composer install`, run `php run-tests.php`.

You can install the [Pux](https://github.com/c9s/pux) extension to test that as well. If the extension is not
installed, the tests will fallback to the pure PHP implementation of Pux.

To test the [R3 library](https://github.com/c9s/php-r3), you also need to install that extension. If the extension is
not installed, the tests for R3 will be skipped.

## Currently

The current test creates **1000** routes, each with a randomized prefix and postfix, with **9** parameters each.

It was run with the [Pux](https://github.com/c9s/pux) and [R3](https://github.com/c9s/php-r3) extensions enabled.

An example route: `/9b37eef21e/{arg1}/{arg2}/{arg3}/{arg4}/{arg5}/{arg6}/{arg7}/{arg8}/{arg9}/bda37e9f9b`

## Worst-case matching

```bash
php run-worst-tests.php
```

This benchmark matches the last route and unknown route. It generates a randomly prefixed and suffixed route in an attempt to thwart any optimization.
1,000 routes each with 9 arguments.

This benchmark consists of 22 tests. Each test is executed 1,000 times, the results pruned, and then averaged. Values that fall outside of 3 standard d
eviations of the mean are discarded.

## First route matching

```bash
php run-first-tests.php
```

This benchmark tests how quickly each router can match the first route. 1,000 routes each with 9 arguments.

This benchmark consists of 11 tests. Each test is executed 1,000 times, the results pruned, and then averaged. Values that fall outside of 3 standard deviations of the mean are discarded.
